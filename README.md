Logging for **Dart/Flutter** applications.

It's very similar to Android logging library called [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) and also with the package for Dart/Flutter called [Fimber](https://github.com/magillus/flutter-fimber) that implements the same concept of the tree and planting logging tree.

Behavior is added through `Tree` instances. You can install an instance by calling Groveman.plantTree. Installation of Trees should be done as early as possible, e.g, in the function `main`.

There are no Tree implementations installed by default because, second `Timber`, every time you log in production, a puppy dies.

Start with the base package [groveman](https://pub.dev/packages/groveman).

## Trees officially supported

- debug_tree (included in the `groveman` package)
- [groveman_crashlytics](https://pub.dev/packages/groveman_crashlytics)

You can create your, just extend the `Tree` class. 
Take a look at the `DebugTree` code to know more.
